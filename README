The Status Menu application
===========================

The hildon-status-menu process implements Status menu and Status area.
The Status menu displays windows of dynamically loaded Gtk+ applets.
All available Status menu applets are displayed in the menu, and some
of them might have an icon in the Status area, depending on the
configuration. Status menu applets can start new applications using the
D-Bus autoactivation system, and they can display controls that the
user can directly manipulate on their window. The Status area is
basically a button that allows the user open the Status menu. Status
area expands to accommodate its plugin icons (from selected Status menu
plugins), but it has a pre-configured limit for the maximum number of
plugin icons.

For the Status Menu API see libhildondesktop.
